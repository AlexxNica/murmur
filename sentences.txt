# This is the configuration file for speecher.
# Blank lines and lines beginning with # are ignored.
# All other lines should start with a directory name followed
# by one or more whitespaces and the sentence that we want the user to read.
# WAV files of those sentences will be saved in uploads/<dirname>/.
# The lines are split on the first whitespace, so directory names
# may not contain spaces.
